import { createPalindromeSDK } from '@/lib/createSDK';

const { sdk, walletClient } = await connectAndInitSDK();

try {
  const txHash = await sdk.withdraw(
    walletClient,
    42n,
    "0xUSDCAddress...",    // Token to withdraw
    1000000n,              // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
    "0xMyWallet..."        // Destination
  );

  console.log("Withdrawal successful!");
  console.log("Transaction:", txHash);

} catch (error: any) {
